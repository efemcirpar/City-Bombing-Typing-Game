# City-Bombing-Typing-Game-in-C


This is a game where you need to enter the words on the bomb. The aim is to correctly type the words that appear on the bombs dropped by the plane. The game features:

- With each correct keystroke, the correctly typed letter is removed from the screen.
- When all letters of a word are entered, the bomb disappears, and the plane drops a new bomb.
- Each correct key stroke = 1 point. Each incorrect key stroke = -1 point.
- Every wrong key stroke speeds up the game.
- The game has a simple "Main Menu" screen. From this screen, you can start a new game or exit the game.
- Pressing the "Esc" key during the game brings up the "Pause Menu" screen. From this screen, you can enter a new game, continue the current game, or exit the game.
- If the bomb reaches the city, the game ends.
